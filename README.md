# Overlook Hotel Booking Site

## Abstract

Overlook is a hotel management tool that allows a user to login with a username and password to view their past and upcoming booking information, and make a reservation with a date and room type filter. This was the final solo project for Mod 2 of the Front End Engineering program at the Turing School of Software & Design.
