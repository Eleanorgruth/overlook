# Overlook Hotel Booking Site

## Abstract

Overlook is a hotel management tool that allows a user to login with a username and password to view their past and upcoming booking information, and make a reservation with a date and room type filter. This was the final solo project for Mod 2 of the Front End Engineering program at the Turing School of Software & Design.

A valid username will start with 'username' and end with a number between 1 and 50 (there are 50 users in the users API). All users have the same password: overlook2021.
